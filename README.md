Keep in mind, I never advice to supply the `amount` field from the client.  

If your business knows the tariff, predefined, just keep it on your server, database table or such, so that the client side cannot alter the value.

Also security ultimately is about being emotional. No system is confidently secure. So as long as a genius didn't discover anything or some cracks. No news is good news.
